PART 2: Glossary  
* **Branch:**  Contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or main branch. After making changes, the branch can be merged back to the main branch to be officially published.
* **Clone:**  A copy of a repository on your computer that can be edited in a preferred editor offline. It is connected to the remote version so local changes can still be synced when online again. 
* **Commit:**  An individual change or "revision" to a file. Git allows you to keep record of these changes which are usually accompanied with a brief commit message of what was changed. 
* **Fetch:**  Allows you to add and review changes from the remote repository before committing them to your local branch.
* **GIT:**  An open source program written by the author of the Linux operating system to track changes in text files. 
* **Github:**  A code hosting platform for collaboration and version control that lets you and others work together on projects while recording code changes.
* **Merge:**  Takes the changes from one branch in the same respository and applies them to another, often as a "pull request" or via command line. 
* **Merge Conflict:**  A difference that occurs between merged branches that must be resolved before branches can be merged. Often happens when people make different changes to the same line or if an edited file is deleted by another.
* **Push:**   To send committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
* **Pull:**  Occurs when fetching in changes and merging them. If someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, those changes should be pulled to your local copy so that it's up to date.
* **Remote:**  A version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server like GitHub.com and can be connected to local clones so that changes sync.
* **Repository:**  Similar to a project's folder that contains all of the project files and stores each file's revision history. It can be public or private with multiple collaborators.

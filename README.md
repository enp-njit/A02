PART 2: Glossary  
* **Branch:**  an individual project with a unique set of code contained within a repository and can be merged to the main branch to be officially published.
* **Clone:**  A copy of a repository on your computer that can be edited in a preferred editor. It is connected to the remote version so local changes can be synced when online. 
* **Commit:**  A revision to a file. Git allows you to keep record of these changes which are usually accompanied with a brief commit message of what was altered. 
* **Fetch:**  Allows you to add and review changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
* **GIT:**  An open source program written by the author of the Linux operating system to track changes in any set of computer files. 
* **Github:**  A code hosting platform for development, collaboration, and version control that lets programmers work together on projects while recording code changes.
* **Merge:**  Takes the changes from one branch in the same respository and applies them to another, often as a "pull request" or via command line. 
* **Merge Conflict:**  A difference that occurs between merged branches that must be resolved before branches can be merged. Often occurs when people make different changes to the same line or if an edited file is deleted by another.
* **Push:**   To send committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
* **Pull:**  Occurs when fetching changes and merging them. Content from a remote repository is downloaded to update a local repository so that the content matches and is up to date.
* **Remote:**  A version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server like GitHub.com and can be connected to local clones so that changes sync.
* **Repository:**  Similar to a project's folder that contains all of the project files and stores each file's revision history. It can be public or private with multiple collaborators.

PART 1: Directions on using Git/Webstorm/GitHub  
1.  Install Webstorm by downloading from https://www.jetbrains.com/student/ 
2.  Install the latest Git as a local program https://git-scm.com/downloads
3.  Create a Github account on https://github.com/join  
4.  Connect Github and Webstorm by accessing Webstorm version control in system preferences and entering the path to your git.exe file. Make sure you register your account by signing in to Github
5.  In Webstorm, create a new project and select the directory where it will be stored
6.  Add Webstorm files by going to file, new, and selecting HTML file and/or Stylesheet (CSS)
7.  Enable version control integration by going to VCS menu at the top of the screen and select Git
8.  Add your files to Git by heading to the commit section in the left hand side and select desired files
9.  Save your code by committing and pushing these files to Git. Make sure to add a commit message of what was done or revised
10. Add your project on Github by searching "share project on GitHub" in Webstorm
11. Create a repository name for GitHub. Make sure it is public so that it can viewed
12. When the repository has been shared, the IDE will provide a pop-up link to open the repo in a browser
13. Your file is now on Github and can be shared with others
14. To set up Github pages, click on the repo's setting, pages, and choose a Github page location by selecting "master branch"
15. Take the Github.io URl and paste it into your browser to test your file


PART 2: Glossary  
* **Branch:**  an individual project with a unique set of code contained within a repository and can be merged to the main branch to be officially published.
* **Clone:**  A copy of a repository on your computer that can be edited in a preferred editor. It is connected to the remote version so local changes can be synced when online. 
* **Commit:**  A revision to a file. Git allows you to keep record of these changes which are usually accompanied with a brief commit message of what was altered. 
* **Fetch:**  Allows you to add and review changes from a remote repository into your local repository.
* **GIT:**  An open source program written by the author of the Linux operating system to track changes in any set of computer files. 
* **Github:**  A code hosting platform for development, collaboration, and version control that lets programmers work together on projects while recording code changes.
* **Merge:**  Takes the changes from one branch in the same respository and applies them to another, often as a "pull request" or via command line. 
* **Merge Conflict:**  A difference that occurs between merged branches that must be resolved before branches can be merged. Often occurs when people make different changes to the same line or if an edited file is deleted by another.
* **Push:**   To send committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
* **Pull:**  Occurs when fetching changes and merging them. Content from a remote repository is downloaded to update a local repository so that the content matches and is up to date.
* **Remote:**  A version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server like GitHub.com and can be connected to local clones so that changes sync.
* **Repository:**  Similar to a project's folder that contains all of the project files and stores each file's revision history. It can be public or private with multiple collaborators.
